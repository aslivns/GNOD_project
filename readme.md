I will write a walkthrough about the project:

1. Lab_6.01_GNOD_part1_and_part2.ipynb
        -here we did web scraping on a website, top 100 songs and wrote a simple recommender
        -I saved top_100_songs.csv to use later
2. Lab_6.05_API_wrappers.ipynb 
        -is about creating a spotify list
        -here I saved my list as asli_playlist.csv, about 5000 songs
3. Lab_6.07_Unsupervised_learning.ipynb 
        -is the lab I assigned 8 clusters.
        -playlist_8_cluster.csv, playlist_scaled_csv
4. for_pickle_kmeans_and_transformer_run_this.ipynb
        -here I made a short copy of my scaler and kmeans and scaler to pickle in this folder
5. FINAL_Song_Recommender.ipynb
        -is the recommender
